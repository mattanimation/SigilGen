From Andy Reagan
You can make the sentiment time series from those 10,222x200 matrices, let me explain how quickly.
Take each column (10,222 long), and normalize it to have a sum of 1 (divide by the sum).
Then take a the dot product (a dot b = a_1 * b_1 + ... + a_10222 * b_10222) of each of the 200 columns with the sentiment vector.
Those 200 numbers are the time series.
Here's that vector that you need to multiply by:

I'm excited to see what you come up with!

Here's a link to the "mode" for each book:
